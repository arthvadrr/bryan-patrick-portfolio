## Misc

```ts
   * If you don't know what display: contents does it's simple. Imagine this:
   *
   * Grandparent = table
   * Parent = cardboard box
   * Child = cat
   *
   * <Table>
   *  <CardboardBox>
   *    <Cat>
   *  </CardboardBox>
   * </Table>
   *
   * The cat is in the cardboard box. He likes the box.
   *
   *     /\_/\\
   *    ( o.o )
   *     > ^ <
   *   +-------+
   *   |  BOX  |
   *   +-------+
   =================
   *    TABLE
   *
   * display: contents on the box means:
   *
   * The box disappears, but the cat stays.
   * Now the cat "acts" like it is directly on the table.
   *
   * The page layout behaves like the box is gone:
   *
   * <Table>
   *   <Cat>
   * </Table>
   *
   * The cat is slightly annoyed. He knocks your glass off the table
   *
   *      /\_/\\
   *  /  ( o.o )    |  |
   * |    > ^ <.    |__|
   * |\  |    |===88|__|
   =================
   *    TABLE
   *================================================================*/

Shipping fast is mostly about scope control, not typing speed.

Pick one thin vertical slice that can move from idea to production in under a day.

## Practical Sequence

1. Write one success signal before coding.
2. Build the smallest path that proves the behavior.
3. Release safely, then collect feedback.

```ts /baseline/#v
type SuccessSignal = {
  event: 'bookmark_saved';
  baseline: number;
  targetLiftPercent: number;
};
```

This avoids building large, speculative work before learning from real users.
